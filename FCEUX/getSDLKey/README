1. Dependencies:
  gcc
  make 
  libsdl

2. Installing
Run "make" to compile to "getSDLKey".  Run "make install" as root if you would like to install "getSDLKey" into a user-specified PREFIX.

3. Running
Type "./getSDLKey" while in this directory to run.

4. About this tool.
This is a tool to determine what the SDL keysym for a particular key on your keyboard is.  This is especially useful when mapping hotkeys to FCEUX.  Take a look at an excerpt of ~/.fceux/fceux.cfg:

 SDL.Hotkeys.SaveState = 286

Apparently, F5 on my system is SDL keysym 286.  If you wanted to remap this to a different key, run ./getSDLKey and press the desired key to see what keysym you should modify your configuration with.

5. Bugs
You can report any issues with this tool in the FCEUX SourceForge bugtracker.  Alternatively, you can contact me directly at LTsmooth42 _at_ gmail _dot_ com.

6. Future
I plan to implement a GUI for remapping these keys so you dont have to do this in the future, but were all very busy people, arent we?
