The following games are broken to some extent:

Crystalis:		Mostly working, but the screen jumps around during
			dialogue.  It apparently resets the MMC3 IRQ counter
			mid-scanline.  It'll require low-level PPU and MMC3
			IRQ counter emulation to function properly.
Kyoro Chan Land:	Expects a sprite hit to happen, but it has sprite 0 over
			transparent background.

*** First, things that are not on the TODO list(Don't bug me about these
	things if you're an idiot.  I don't like listening to idiots.
	If you are not an idiot, and you can make decent arguments for why
	these should be on the TODO list, then you can bug me.).

*** General Features:

 Remappable command keys(to multiple keys on the keyboard and a joystick).

 Fix possible UNIF crashes(if no PRGx or CHRx chunks exist, it may crash,
 due to changes made in 0.92).

 Windows Port:
  Support for command-line options(so that one crazy guy will quit bugging
  me).

 SDL Port:
   Hotkey remap GUI

 Figure out a good way to add "turbo" button support and then do it.

 Make default svgalib video mode a non-tweaked VGA mode.

 Finish the software video blitting "library", add support for 2xsai, eagle,
 interpolation, etc. effects.


*** Emulation:


 ***IMPORTANT***
 If anyone ever cares to implement movie recording/playback, we must figure
 out what to do with some unsaved variables, like timestamp and timestampbase.
 These variables are abused in the sound emulation code, and modifying them
 in certain ways elsewhere can cause crashes.
 ***IMPORTANT***

 Implement cart-based expansion devices, and interfaces for them(dip switches
 and that Datach barcode reader, and maybe others).

 Fix DPCM playback and IRQ at end of playback.

 Fix some 6502 emulation bugs(undocumented opcodes might not be implemented 
 correctly and I'm not sure if the IRQ flag latency is implemented correctly).

 Implement more dummy CPU reads when in debug mode.

 Fix MMC3 IRQ emulation.  

 Figure out correct timing for when the PPU refresh address register is
 updated by the PPU(for the next scanline).

 Sound frame count stuff on PAL games(is it correct?).
 
 Fix FDS sound emulation.

 Fix NMI timing and D7 of 2002 setting timing.  Fixing this might require
 a small hack.  Also be aware that this might break Battletoads, particularly
 during the second level.

 Fix Zapper emulation(Chiller still doesn't always work correctly).
