FCE Ultra was developed with gcc and GNU make in mind.  MSVC will probably
compile the Windows source code with a few modifications, but you'll still 
need to make a project file.

Several pre-made makefiles are provided:
	Makefile.beos		- BeOS(with SDL and SDL_net)
	Makefile.unixsdl	- UN*X(FreeBSD/Linux/etc, with SDL)
	Makefile.linuxvga	- Linux(with svgalib)
	Makefile.dos		- (MS/PC/DR) DOS
	Makefile.win		- MS Windows 9x/Me/Xp/2000/etc.(with DirectX).
	Makefile.macosx		- Mac OS X(with SDL)

If you want to use Makefile.beos or Makefile.unixsdl for a cpu type other
than 80x86, you will need to remove "-DC80x86" from the defines line
and also remove "-DLSB_FIRST" if your target cpu uses MSB first ordering.
You'll also need to remove/change "-mcpu=xxx".

For the Windows port, I use MINGW32.  http://www.mingw.org

To compile the DOS port, you'll need to download the DJGPP package.
Any version of gcc >=2.95.3 should compile the code without changes, BUT
the DJGPP versions of gcc have some problems:
  gcc 2.95.3 sometimes breaks when compiling the code.  gcc 3.0.2 seems to 
  produce bad code for sound.c.  So, I recommend using gcc 3.0.4 for
  compiling the DOS version.

Modifying the "-mcpu=i686" string in the makefiles, to optimize more effectively
for your cpu type, is a good idea.

Always do a "make -f Makefile.<platform> clean" before compiling for a 
different platform or if you update via cvs and if you have stale object 
files lying around.
